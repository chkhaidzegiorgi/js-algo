# Bubble Sort

![N|Solid](../../../../assets/bubble-sort.gif)

Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple [sorting algorithm] that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and [swaps] them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted. The algorithm, which is a [comparison sort], is named for the way smaller or larger elements "bubble" to the top of the list.

The Bubble Sort fits in the category of Exchange Sorts due to the manner in which elements are moved inside the data set during the sorting process.

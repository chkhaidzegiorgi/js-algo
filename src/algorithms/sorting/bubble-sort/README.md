# Bubble Sort

![N|Solid](../../assets/bubble-sort.gif)

Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple [sorting algorithm] that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and [swaps] them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted. The algorithm, which is a [comparison sort], is named for the way smaller or larger elements "bubble" to the top of the list.

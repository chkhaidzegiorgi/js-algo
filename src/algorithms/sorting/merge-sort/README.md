# Merge Sort

In computer science, merge sort (also commonly spelled mergesort) is an efficient, general-purpose, [comparison-based] [sorting algorithm]. Most implementations produce a [stable sort], which means that the order of equal elements is the same in the input and output. Merge sort is a [divide and conquer algorithm] that was invented by [John von Neumann] in 1945. A detailed description and analysis of bottom-up mergesort appeared in a report by [Goldstine] and [von Neumann] as early as 1948.
